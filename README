# Build the image: 

We create an image, called `mmattioni/dna2protein`, and build it using the `Dockerfile`.
Note: `mmattioni` is the username on the Seven Bridges Platform, `dna2protein` is the 
development project we have created there. Change them to yours otherwise won't work.

	docker build -t mmattioni/dna2protein .
	
# We can launch a container, and see if we have everything we need.

	docker run -it mmattioni/dna2protein bash
	
# Launch our scripts from the container:

	docker run mmattioni/dna2protein transcribe.py -h
	docker run mmattioni/dna2protein translate.py -h
	
Now our scripts are dockerized and we can use it directly from the image.

# Push our image to the SevenBridges registry

First we need to tag the image. Make sure you have create a dev project called `dna2protein`, otherwise you will
not be able to push the image.

	docker tag mmattioni/dna2protein images.sbgenomics.com/mmattioni/dna2protein

Now we login and push it to the registry. Note: you have to provide you API TOKEN, not the password you use to log 
on the Seven Bridges Platform.

	docker login --username <SBG_USERNAME> --email <SBG_EMAIL> --password <SBG_API_TOKEN> images.sbgenomics.com
	docker push mmattioni/dna2protein
